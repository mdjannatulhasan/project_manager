Based on your lead's feedback, here are the key areas you should focus on learning next in Ruby on Rails:

## **Priority 1: Frontend Folder Structure **
- **Asset Pipeline**: How Rails handles CSS, JavaScript, and images
- **Webpacker/Vite**: Modern asset bundling (check if your project uses these)
- **Stimulus**: Rails' JavaScript framework (you already have controllers set up)
- **Turbo**: For seamless page updates without full reloads
- **Frontend build tools**: How CSS/JS gets compiled and served

## **Priority 2: API Development**
- **RESTful APIs**: Creating JSON endpoints
- **API-only mode**: Rails API vs full Rails app
- **JSON serialization**: How to format API responses
- **API authentication**: Token-based auth, JWT
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing for APIs

## **Priority 3: Common Scripting Patterns**
- **Rake tasks**: Custom scripts for maintenance/automation
- **Rails generators**: Creating models, controllers, migrations
- **Database migrations**: Schema changes and data transformations
- **Seeds**: Populating database with initial data
- **Background jobs**: Sidekiq, Delayed Job for async processing

## **Priority 4: AJAX & Dynamic Interactions**
- **UJS (Unobtrusive JavaScript)**: Rails' approach to AJAX
- **Stimulus controllers**: Event handling and DOM manipulation
- **Form submissions**: Remote forms and partial updates
- **Real-time features**: Action Cable for WebSockets

## **Priority 5: Styling & UI**
- **CSS frameworks**: Bootstrap, Tailwind (you have Tailwind set up)
- **Asset helpers**: `image_tag`, `stylesheet_link_tag`
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approaches
- **CSS preprocessing**: SCSS/Sass if used

## **Learning Path Recommendation:**
1. **Start with frontend folder structure** - dive into your current project's `app/assets/` and `app/javascript/`
2. **Build a simple API endpoint** - create a controller that returns JSON
3. **Learn Stimulus** - enhance your existing hello_controller
4. **Practice with AJAX** - make forms submit without page reload
5. **Explore Rake tasks** - create a simple maintenance script

Since you're new, I'd suggest focusing on one area at a time and building small projects to practice each concept. Would you like me to help you explore any of these areas in your current Rails project?
