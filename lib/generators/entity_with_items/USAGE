Description:
    Generate a main entity with associated items and complete API structure.
    This creates a professional Rails API setup with nested resources.

Example:
    bin/rails generate entity_with_items Product

    This will create:
        - Product model (name, description, status)
        - Item model with product reference
        - Api::Products controller
        - Api::Products::Items controller  
        - Nested API routes
        - Sample seed data file
        - Database migrations

    After generation:
        1. Run: bin/rails db:migrate
        2. Run: bin/rails db:seed
        3. Test API endpoints

    API Endpoints created:
        GET    /api/products
        POST   /api/products
        GET    /api/products/:id
        PATCH  /api/products/:id
        DELETE /api/products/:id
        GET    /api/products/:id/items
        POST   /api/products/:id/items
        etc.

    Other examples:
        bin/rails generate entity_with_items Campaign    # Campaign + Items
        bin/rails generate entity_with_items Event       # Event + Items
        bin/rails generate entity_with_items Project     # Project + Items
